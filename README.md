This is a card game where the player plays against a dealer. the value of the card is based on the number 2-10. and facecards are worth 10 and Ace is worth 1 or 11. The player is dealt 2 cards face up and the dealer is dealt 1 card up 1 card down. The player can then decide to "hit" or "stand". The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over. The dealer must hit on any total 16 or below. The player wins when their hand is higher than the dealers or if the dealer busts(if the player didn't go over 21). If the player goes over 21 or has a lower total than the dealer then they lose. If both the player and dealer have the same total then it is a tie.
